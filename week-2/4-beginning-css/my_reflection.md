- What seems good and bad about CSS?
- Did you have any "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
- Did you have any experience before with HTML/CSS? If so, how much? If not, how hard did you feel it was to learn?
- When you looked at the Berkshire Hathaway site, what were your first impressions of their code?
- Which code was better, yours or theirs?
- What do you think made one better than the other?
- Based on what you've read, which site uses better best practices?
