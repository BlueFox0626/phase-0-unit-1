# U1.W2: Intro Design

## Learning Competencies
- Learn about the 6 Phases of Web Design
- Learn about user experience design

## Summary
Many people think "web design" simply means how the site looks. This couldn't be farther from the truth! The practice of web design centers around usability, navigation, and accessibility.

Regardless of whether design is interesting to you or not, web design
matters to end users. If your site isn't easy to read, navigate, or access, you risk losing users.

In this exercise, you will learn about design thinking and take the first steps toward creating your own personal Phase 0 website.

## Releases

## Release 0: Intro to Design Thinking
Like software engineers, designers are problem solvers. They just solve problems visually instead of with code. For some of you, this may come really naturally;
for others it may not. Either is OK.

## Release 1: Information Gathering
The first step in creating a website is defining its purpose and target audience. You must know your site's goals and end users before you can think about its layout or design.

In this unit, you'll be creating your own Phase 0 website where you'll post your weekly blog entries. It will be used after your graduate as a portfolio, so think about what content you'd like to see on there.

You'll probably want:

  - Your contact information
  - A link to your blog assignments (You will have technical and cultural blog assignments each week in Phase 0)
  - About me
  - Your projects

With this mind, give some thought to the following questions, then navigate to the my_reflection.md page for this challenge to answer them.

1. What is your site's primary goal or purpose?
2. What kind of content will your site feature?
3. What is the best way to share that content with users?
4. Think about your target audience. What are their interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
5. How do you think most users will find your site?
6. What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

## Release 2: Site Map
Site maps illustrate the heriarchy of your website in diagram form. They visually explain the relationships between pages of content on your website, making it easier for you to conceptualize how information flows to the user. You can also begin to think about what languages and elements you will need to best present this information to the user.

Site maps should be reflections of your site. So if you have a simple site with only a few pages, you will probably only have a couple boxes of information underneath your index. If you have a very complex site, you might have more, with several levels.

Now you'll create a site map for your site! You can draw the map, though you are also welcome to use tools such as Adobe Photoshop, [http://writemaps.com](WriteMaps), or [http://slickplan.com](Slickplan).

For now, your site map will probably be really simple -- maybe an index page with a few supplemental pages. But as you expand your portfolio and grow your site, you may find yourself adding more and more pages. The great thing about a site map is that it can grow and change with your website.

## Release 3: Reflection
On your local `phase-0-unit-1` repo, edit the [my_reflection.md](my_reflection.md) file associated with this challenge. Commit your changes and save them to GitHub.
