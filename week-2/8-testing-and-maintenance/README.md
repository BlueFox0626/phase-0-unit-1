# U1.W2: Testing and Maintenance

## Learning Competencies
- Learn about testing and website maintenance
- Read through and incorporate feedback
- Create a weekly maintenance schedule

## Summary
Now that your website is live, it's time to make sure your code works! You'll also create a maintenance schedule to incorporate feedback and respond to new needs.

## Releases

## Release 0: Reading Feedback
Once you've got some feedback about your site from your fellow boots, it's time to read through it and decide what you want to incorporate and how soon. Remember, you don't have to incorporate everything today, or even this week! Building a website is a process that involves constant fine-tuning.

## Release 1: Testing your code
It's time to test your code. First, open up your site in the browser and make sure that all your links work and direct where they should. Go through every single link. It may take a while, but it's important that your links are correctly coded.

Then go through and make sure all of your CSS and HTML is operating like you imagined. For example, if you're using the :hover pseudo-element, make sure that it's manifesting correctly on the page.

## Release 2: Set a Maintenance Schedule
While it's possible to build a website and then never touch it again, that doesn't make for the best site. It's important that you constantly update your site to reflect new feedback and any new features you want to incorporate.

Design a weekly schedule strictly for website maintenance. You can do this on a piece of paper, a word document, an excel sheet, or on a calendar. Timebox these sessions so you don't spend too much time each week on your site and not enough on your weekly exercises. When you're done, take a picture or screencap of your schedule and upload it with your reflection.

As you work with your site, you may find that some weeks you won't spend the entire time you blocked off. That's ok -- as you work more and more on your site, you will fall into a rhythm of maintenance that works for you.
