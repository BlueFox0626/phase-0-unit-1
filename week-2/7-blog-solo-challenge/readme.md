# U1.W2: More HTML & CSS

**THIS IS YOUR SOLO CHALLENGE FOR WEEK 2.** Please reference the [Phase 0 Handbook](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/) for more details as to what this entails.

## Learning Competencies
- Use a wireframe to construct a website
- Position HTML elements using CSS padding, borders, and margins
- Use HTML tags to present content on a website

## Summary
In this challenge, you will be building the index of your website using the wireframe you make in the [6-wireframing](../6-wireframing) challenge. You may not use Bootstrap or any other design framework for your site. 

## Releases

## Release 0: Wireframe to HTML

Using your wireframe as a reference, add content to your index.html page in your [USERNAME].github.io site using HTML. 

You should include links to each social networking site. Use an image to tell your audience which site it is rather than text. 

Add the other information. Make sure to have a header, footer, and navigation bar. 

Once you have all of the content on your site, you are ready to add CSS. 

You can put placeholders into links if you do not have URLs for them yet (such as your blog section).


## Release 1: Apply CSS

- Add styling to your header, footer, and navigation bar. 
- Style and position the content to match your wireframe.

## Release 2: Publish your site

When you feel ready to publish your new, beautiful site, commit your changes! 

If you are using the command line, you'll need to add each file you changed to the stage, commit them, and push them to master. 

## Release 3: Reflect
On your local `phase-0-unit-1` repo, edit the [my_reflection.md](my_reflection.md) file associated with this challenge. Commit your changes and push them to GitHub.

## Release 4: Pseudo-Selectors (Optional)
