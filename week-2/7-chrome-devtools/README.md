# U1.W2: Chrome DevTools

## Learning Competencies
- Navigate and edit a website's HTML and CSS elements using the Chrome DevTools inspector
- Explain what the DOM is and how it relates to CSS and HTML
- Identify images and other page elements that cause slow performance
- Use Chrome DevTools to manipulate elements in the DOM

## Summary
Before starting this challenge, you will want to do a bit of research on the DOM. Read/watch the following resources before beginning.
- [Mozilla's introduction to the DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/DOM_Reference/Introduction) or [Skillcrush's introduction to the DOM](http://skillcrush.com/2012/10/17/dom-document-object-model/)
- [Introduction to the DOM (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0ZcldkGlt8)

In this challenge, you'll be diving into Chrome DevTools. Inside the DevTools inspector window is an inner world of data that is communicated between the browser and server. These tools are invaluable for you as a developer and getting comfortable with them will help optimize your HTML and CSS editing, JavaScript debugging, and overall site performance.

We'll focus primarily on real-time HTML and CSS editing in this challenge.

## Release 0: Learn about Chrome's DevTools

Watch:
- [Don't Fear the Browser: Developer Tools & Vanilla Ice Cream](http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com/the-basics/dont-fear-the-browser)

Take [Code School's DevTools course](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/):
  - Chapter 1: Getting Started & Basic DOM and Styles
  - Chapter 2: Advanced DOM and Styles

Take the quizzes at the end of each chapter. You'll want to create a free account with Code School so you can accumulate badges and credits for the chapters you complete. There are also questions in the quiz that will explore the concepts and tools introduced in those chapters.

## Release 1: Practice
Complete the [dev_tools_practice.md](dev_tools_practice.md) activity.

Take a screenshot of your Code School points (they appear on the right of your Code School profile page), add the file to your imgs directory in the `3-chrome-devtools` directory, and include the image in the [dev_tools_practice.md](dev_tools_practice.md) file.

## Release 2: Experiment

Visit [code.tutsplus.com](http://code.tutsplus.com/) (a Wordpress blog devoted to improving development and technical skills). Select a blog post you are interested in. Use DevTools to take a peek into the site. How does it differ from your github.io site's HTML and CSS?

Play with the CSS using Devtools to:
 - Change the background color of the page
 - Center the title in the page
 - Indent a paragraph by 3em
 - Change the color of the text of an element in the navigation bar
 - Change the title of the post to "No Soup for You" and the author to your name

Based on your experimentation, What are the benefits of experimenting in DevTools versus editing the code files themselves?

## Release 3: Reflect
Go to your [Reflection file](my_reflection.md) to write your reflection - include answers to the questions in the file in addition to the [reflection guidelines](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md).

## Release 4: Commit and Push
Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
