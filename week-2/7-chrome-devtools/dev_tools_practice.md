* Which tab supports realtime editing of HTML and CSS?

* What's the quick key for your OS to spawn the Dev Tools inspector?

* Load the HTML page in your browser and open the Dev Tools inspector.
  * First, play around with the boxes a while. How can you manipulate them in different ways?
  * Try to make all the boxes line up in a row.

It should match this screenshot:

  ![CSS Positioning and DevTools](imgs/devtools-img.jpg)

  * Upload your own image to the imgs directory in the `6-chrome-devtools` directory.  Don't take a screenshot of your whole desktop, just the browser window. Display your image inline here.(This is part of the challenge.)

  * Then...have fun! Move the boxes around, change their sizes and colors, and put in some new text. Take a screencap of your favorite configuration and upload it to the imgs directory.
