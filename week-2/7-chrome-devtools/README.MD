# U1.W2: Chrome DevTools

## Learning Competencies
- Navigate and edit a website's HTML and CSS elements using the Chrome DevTools inspector
- Explain what the DOM is and how it relates to CSS and HTML
- Use Chrome DevTools to manipulate elements in the DOM

## Summary
Before starting this challenge, you will want to do a bit of research on the DOM. Read/watch the following resources before beginning.
- [Skillcrush's introduction to the DOM](http://skillcrush.com/2012/10/17/dom-document-object-model/)
- [Introduction to the DOM (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0ZcldkGlt8)

In this challenge, you'll be diving into Chrome DevTools. Inside the DevTools inspector window is an inner world of data that is communicated between the browser and server. These tools are invaluable for you as a developer and getting comfortable with them will help optimize your HTML and CSS editing, JavaScript debugging, and overall site performance.

We'll focus primarily on real-time HTML and CSS editing in this challenge.
