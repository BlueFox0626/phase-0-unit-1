# U1.W1: Git, Github, and the Command Line

## Learning Competencies

## Summary
Each week's curriculum includes a mandatory blogging component. In the tech community, blogging demonstrates a willingness to give back by teaching others. Blogging also requires you to practice researching and synthesizing information, both of which are vital to your growth as a developer.

As you may have guessed from the [Twitter challenge](9-twitter-intro.md), being active on social media and blogging will be important to your future career prospects as well. If a hiring manager has two candidates to compare, both of which are equal except one is an active blogger and tweeter, that candidate will likely have an advantage.

That said, no one expects your blog to be mind-blowingly good. You have only been learning this stuff for a week after all! The purpose of the blog is to show your growth and willingness to put yourself out there. When you graduate from DBC, one of the phrases you'll use to promote yourself is that you are a fast learner -- so what better way to show it than to give them a link to your blog?
