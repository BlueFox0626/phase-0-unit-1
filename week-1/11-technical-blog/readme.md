# U1.W1: Your Favorite Websites


## Learning Competencies
- Evaluate websites in terms of design and user experience
- Compare websites to one another to discuss the pros and cons of their approaches

## Summary
In the same way that professors and graduate students are required to contribute through publications, developers are expected to make contributions to their field through blog posts, presentations to their peers, and forums like Stack Overflow. In Phase 0, you will start your contributions by blogging about cultural and technical topics that correspond to the week's topics. 

## Releases

## Release 0: Create your file

You should have already created your [blog-template](../9-blog-template-solo-challenge). In your blog-posts directory, create a new HTML file called "t1-compare-websites.html." Copy the code from your blog-template into the new html file.

## Release 1: Identify 3 Sites

Identify three of your favorite websites. 

## Release 2: Consider the Design

Ask yourself:
 - Why is this one of your favorite sites?
 - What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage? Stand back further, what area is your eye drawn to now? Is that area the most important area of the site?
 - How would you describe the website visually? List 5 adjectives. (i.e. "well-branded", "minimalist", "organized", "cluttered", "dated" etc)
 - What problem does this website solve? What content does it have?  
 - What 5 adjectives would you use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site? (i.e. "practical", "entertaining", "aspirational", "informative", "engaging" etc) How does that compare to the adjectives you used to describe the site visually?
 - How easy is it to find what you are looking for from the homepage? How about from another page?
 - How easy is it to browse through all the content of the site?
 - How do you feel after being on the site for a while? (i.e. "bored", "happy", "anxious or hyper", "like I wasted a lot of time" etc)
 - Does the site sell anything? If so, have you purchased any of it? Why or why not?

## Release 3: Blog it

Write a blog post analyzing the three sites in terms of user experience and design.

Don't forget to push your changes to make them live on your github.io site. Double-check that you can see your page when you visit: 

www.[USERNAME].github.io/blog-posts/t1-compare-websites.html

## Release 4: Reflect
On your local `phase-0-unit-1` repo, edit the [my_reflection.md](my_reflection.md) file associated with this challenge. Commit your changes and save them to GitHub in the phase-0-unit-1 repository.

## Release 5: Promote
Share your blog on the google+ community under "Blog Posts!" Read other student blogs. What did you like about them? 

<!-- Now that you've done all that work, promote your blog on Twitter! (Yes, this is actually a requirement - more on the importance of Twitter later). -->
