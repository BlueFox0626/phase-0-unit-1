# U1.W1: Beginning CSS

## Learning Competencies
- Link an external stylesheet to an html document
- 

## Summary
In this challenge, you will be adding CSS to your clone of [Berkshire Hathaway's website](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/). 

## Releases:

## Release 0: Set up your Stylesheet
There are multiple ways to add CSS to HTML, but we generally prefer keeping formatting in a separate file, called a stylesheet. In this directory, you will see a file [my-berkshire-stylesheet.css](my-berkshire-stylesheet.css). This is the file you will be adding your styling to. 

If you look at that file, you will see there is already something there. It's set to turn the background color to red when you get the external stylesheet set up properly. Then you can promptly delete that piece of CSS. 

You'll want to add a link to this stylesheet in your [4-beginning-html/my-berkshire-site.html](../4-beginning-html/my-berkshire-site.html)
