# Fork and clone a github repository

## Objectives
- Teach non-git users how and why to fork a repository
- Ability to copy Github files to your computer

## Release 0
We created this handy video walking through the process of forking and cloning your curriculum. CHeck it out here **INSERT YOURTUBE LINK TO FORKANDLCONE**.

## Release 1
Now that you have SEEN it, lets put our knowledge to the test. Fork the phase-0-unit-1 repo into your collection. For good measure, delete your newly forked repo and fork it again. It is good to walk through the process a couple times to make sure you understand it. If you can do it without referencing the video you are in a good spot.

We have these beautiful files on github.com just waiting to be modified. Lets bring them to your computer so we can start modifying them. Clone your forked repo using the instructions from the video.

Delete your local copy ( using the command line ) and clone it again, get familiar with the commands and the steps to get a file from github to your computer.

## Release 2
Now that you have your own fork and a local copy of the files to work with, we can share our knowledge with the world. Find someone/thing that will listen to you for 10 minutes and teach them how to fork and clone a repo. Wouldn't it be great if your dog could do this for you?

## Reflection
Take some time and write in the my_reflection.md for this challenge and share some of your Aha! moments. Write up a step by step process to fork and clone a repo.
