# U1.W1: Beginning HTML

## Learning Competencies
- Set up a basic HTML page with the appropriate tags (html, head, title,)
- Add paragraphs, headings, links, images, lists, and/or tables
- Divide content on a page using divs and spans

## Summary
In this challenge, you will be building an html-only clone of [Berkshire Hathaway's website](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/). It's a pretty simple site, but can be done in various ways. 

## Releases

## Release 0: Learn Basic HTML
- Go through [codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web) sections:
  - HTML Basics
  - HTML Basics II (Sections 1-6 Only. Skip the styling sections.)
  - HTML Basics III

## Release 1: Set up your HTML Page
It's time to use the tools you learned in codecademy. In the [my-berkshire-site.html](my-berkshire-site.html), set up your webpage using the appropriate tags. You should have a doctype, html tags, a head, title, body, etc. Don't forget your closing tags!


## Release 2: 
Now it's time to add the "fun" stuff. You don't need to point to the correct URL in the links; instead you can point to a shorter url, like google, but you should try getting the content to look about the same as the image below. 

Consider whether you want to use a table or divs. [This article](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/08/from-table-hell-to-div-hell/) to determine which you'd rather use. 

You don't need to worry about formatting the site since you will be adding it in the [5-beginning-CSS](../5-beginning-CSS) challenge. When you finish adding the content using HTML, you site should look something like this: 

![unformatted berkshire](imgs/unformatted-berkshire.png)

We've included the Geico image for you in the [imgs](imgs) directory for you to use. 

## Release 3: Reflect 
On your local `phase-0-unit-1` repo, edit the [my_reflection.md](my_reflection.md) file associated with this challenge. Commit your changes and save them to GitHub.
