# Week 1: Introduction to HTML and CSS

**Welcome to Phase 0!** We hope you are excited to further your knowledge and begin integrating into the developer and DBC community. Please make sure you've read through the [Phase 0 Handbook](https://github.com/devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook) and completed the prerequisites **before** getting started with the weekly challenges.

This week is quite possibly the most difficult since you will be getting acclimated to Phase 0 as well as learning completely new technologies (git, HTML, and CSS).

Please keep track of how much time you are spending on Phase 0 challenges, we'll ask you for this information in your weekly submission forms to gauge whether we are giving too much, the right amount, or not enough work each week.

When you have questions, are confused, or need help, please post on the Google+ community. Staff and students will post responses. You should never feel alone and stuck during Phase 0. Please reach out to us at phase0@devbootcamp.com if you do.

## Submitting your work

You need to submit your work on **[apply.devbootcamp.com](http://apply.devbootcamp.com) by Sunday at 11:59pm**. When you log in, look at your profile page. There should be a "Unit 1 Week 1 Form." There is also an extension request form for unit 1. If you do not finish your work by the designated time, please complete the extension request. When you finish, you are expected to submit your work on the week submission form. You only get one extension for unit 1, so please keep that in mind.

NOTE: You will have two separate repositories in Github for Unit 1: Your Github.io site and your phase-0-unit-1 repository.

## Remember your Unit Expectations!
- Give feedback for each person you paired with, if any. You need to submit at least 6 pieces of feedback in this unit. (4 for peer pairing, and 2 for GPS)
- Rate at least 7 pieces of [Meta Feedback](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback) on Socrates. (You need to rate 20 pieces of feedback per unit)
- Make sure you sign up for GPS 1.1 and 1.2 on our [scheduling app](https://phase0.devbootcamp.com/login) (These must be done in a session with guide, and there are only enough sessions for students to attend one, so make sure you sign up early!)

## Fetching changes from DBC's master repo
Sometimes we will make changes to the original (Devbootcamp) repository to clarify instructions or add new curriculum. You will need to "fetch" these changes from the master branch when we announce changes on the google+ community. Follow [these](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/fetching-changes.md) directions to do this.
