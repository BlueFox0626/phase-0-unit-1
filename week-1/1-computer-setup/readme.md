# Computer Set-Up Instructions

Setting up your computer can be tricky, and there are specific technologies we will need you to have in Phases 0, 1, and 2. We've created instructions for installing each of these in Linux, Mac, and Windows.

These instructions are new, so please let us know if you encounter problems setting up.

Please go through these even if you already set up your machine just to check you have everything. If you have a Mac, be sure to install the dotfiles (Releases 4 and 5) to make sure your path is set up properly.
