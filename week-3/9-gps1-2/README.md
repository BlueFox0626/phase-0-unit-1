#U1.W3: GPS 1.2: Git Cheat Sheet

**DO NOT LOOK AT THIS CHALLENGE UNTIL YOUR GUIDED PAIRING SESSION!!**

## Learning Competencies
  - Wireframe a website based on requirements
  - Explain the purpose of different HTML elements
  - Link a CSS stylesheet to an HTML file
  - Apply CSS to position elements on an HTML page

## Summary
This GPS is designed to help you examine pair programming and the roles of driver and navigator. Your goal is to design and build a single-page website that introduces the concept of pair programming!

**Don't forget to check in!**

## Release 0: Wireframe the site
First, you'll want to create a wireframe. In this wireframe, you will want to draw space for:
- a Header
- 2 Columns
- a Footer

If you want to use a collaborative drawing site, you can use [Precursor](https://prcrsr.com/) or [flockdraw](http://flockdraw.com) (It's like a collaborative version of MSPaint). You don't need an account, and you can invite people by sharing the URL. You can also use any other wireframing tool and share your screen. (Or use a pen and paper and share)

## Release 1: HTML

Open a stypi file (only one person needs to do this) and name it with a `.html` extension (You will be able to see it in stypi by either hovering or clicking on the "eye" in the top right of the navigation bar). Share the URL with your pair and guide.

Be sure to include a link to the phase-0-unit-1/week-3/9-gps1-2/gps1-2.css stylesheet in your html! It won't work now, but you will be thankful later when you are copying and pasting the html and css into the separate files.

Before you get started on positioning, take a brief look at the HTML and evaluate the following:

- What is the DOCTYPE specifying?
- What is the point of a charset?
- What version of HTML is this? Do you think it's easier, more difficult, or the same in terms of readability as other versions?
- What does `<title>` do?


## Release 2: Position the Elements
Now's the time to position all of the HTML elements based on the wireframe you created. Use CSS as much as possible. It's considered bad practice to incorporate styling into HTML tags.

HINT: Add `background-color` to each element to see where each element is to help you position them.

IF USING STYPI: You will need to add CSS inside the `<style>` tags because stypi won't accept an actual link to an external stylesheet. This isn't good practice though. Why do you think that's the case?

## Release 3: Dress it up!
Once you've got the elements where you want them, you can decide to dress it up. Change the colors, fonts, add pictures of an octocat, etc. Have fun with it.

## Release 4: Reflect

Reflect on your learning. Did you feel more confident with CSS positioning? How did you do with the learning competencies in general? Add your reflection as a comment in your gps1-2.html file.

## Release 5: Copy, commit, and push
When you are finished, copy your code into the [gps1-2.css](gps1-2.css) and [gps1-2.html](gps1-2.html) files. Make sure your css from the `<style>` section is in the CSS file and remove it from the HTML section. Update the html file. Then, test that everything is still  working by saving them and running them together from your computer.

Commit and push your changes onto the phase-0-unit-1 repository.

## Release 6: Publish
Using the terminal, practice copying the html and css sheets into a new folder in your [USERNAME].github.io site. Commit and push your changes to your github.io site. Double check that everything is displaying properly. Then add a link on the index of your site to make sure people can find it!

## Release 7: Give Feedback
Don't forget to give [feedback](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback/new) to your pair!
