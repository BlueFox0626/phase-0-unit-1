#U1.W3: Arrays and Iterators


## Learning Competencies


## Summary
So far you've used variables to store information, but what happens if you have a lot of information to store? Say you want to have a list of your favorite bands, and you are a bit of a music lover so there are hundreds of them. You wouldn't want to have to assign them like so:

```ruby
favorite_band_1 = "Evanescence"
favorite_band_2 = "Nightwish"
favorite_band_3 = "Linkin Park"
```

As you can see, this would take a while. Instead, it would be better to use a different structure to store this information.

## Releases

## Release 0: Read Ch. 8: Arrays and Iterators

In this chapter Pine addresses arrays and iterating over arrays.

## Release 1: Challenges
It will be useful for you to start looking at the [ruby documentation for arrays](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Array.html) at this point. Although it's difficult to read, you should start getting as comfortable as possible with these docs. You can also checkout the docs for other objects as well.

[Find the smallest integer in an array](12-smallest-integer)
[Find the largest integer in an array](13-largest-integer)
[Find the shortest string in an array](14-shortest-string)
[Find the longest string in an array](15-longest-string)
[Concatenate Two Arrays](16-concatenate-arrays)
[Count the numbers in an array between a given range](17-count-between)
