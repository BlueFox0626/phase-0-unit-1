Create a method `get_grade` that accepts an average in the class and returns the letter grade as a `String`.

It should only return one of `'A'`, `'B'`, `'C'`, etc.  Don't worry about `+` and `-` grades.

For example,

```ruby
get_grade(89) # => returns "B", *not* "B+"
get_grade(70) # => returns "C"
```
