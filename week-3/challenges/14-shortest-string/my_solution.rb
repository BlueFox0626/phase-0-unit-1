# U1.W3: Shortest String

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# shortest_string is a method that takes an array of strings as its input
# and returns the shortest string
#
# +array+ is an array of strings
# shortest_string(array) should return the shortest string in +array+
#
# If +array+ is empty the method should return nil

#Your Solution Below
def shortest_string(array)
  # Your code goes here!
end
