# U1.W3: Local variables and basic arithmetical operations


## Learning Competencies
-


## Summary
Create two integer variables called `num1` and `num2` and assign them your favorite numbers.

Next, compute the sum, difference, quotient, product, and modulus of these two numbers and assign these values to variables called `sum`, `difference`, `quotient`, `product`, and `modulus`, respectively.

For the quotient, be sure to convert the variables to `Floats` before dividing.


## Releases

## Release 0: Run the tests
In your terminal, make sure you are in the [easy_add_it_up](./) directory. Type `rspec` followed by the spec file name. ex. `rspec array_total_spec.rb`
Each test should fail. Read the output in your terminal to see what is making the tests fail.
