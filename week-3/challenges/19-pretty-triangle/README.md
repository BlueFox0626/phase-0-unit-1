Write a method `print_triangle` which takes at its input an integer representing the number of rows to print, and prints out a right triangle consisting of `*` characters, one line per row.

For example, `print_triangle(5)` should print out:

```text
*
**
***
****
*****
```

And `print_triangle(2)` should print out:

```text
*
**
```

If we pass in `0` it should print nothing (not even an empty line).
