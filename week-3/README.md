## Fetch DBC's Changes
It's time to fetch changes from DevBootcamp's phase_0_unit 1 master repo! Make sure you are in the master branch of your phase-0-unit-1 repo. Check where you are in your terminal first. DO NOT try fetching these changes into your [USERNAME].github.io repo. You will mess things up!

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/fetching-changes.md)!

## Working through the challenges
Once you have the entire local repository on your computer, you don't need to read the challenges on github anymore (although we admit, it's prettier). You can open the entire repository in sublime and read the challenges in their original markdown. It will also help you find any link issues, since you can see where they are pointing. If you do find broken links, please let us by posting on the community, but also try to figure out a fix. It will help your markdown skills!

# Introduction to JavaScript

<!-- Please do not start week 3. We will release it with changes at least by the Friday before week 3 begins. -->


JavaScript is known as the "language of the web." It is a powerful object-oriented language (Ruby is as well). It is light-weight and can communicate with the browser, but it's also a language in it's own right. This week, we will introduce you to basic JavaScript syntax; we want you to feel comfortable with simple variables and functions.

You will not begin using JavaScript until Phase 2 in Dev Bootcamp, but don't worry if you feel like you will forget everything. You will have the chance to review in the last two weeks of Phase 0 and the weekend before you begin Phase 2. Moreover, professional programmers look up information and syntax all the time. They don't have everything memorized either, so think of this as an introduction. The more you use JavaScript the more you will remember. For our purposes here, we want you to learn basics so that you can easily re-learn them later.

**You have an asynchronous group challenge this week. Take a look at it early so you don't get blind-sided.**

## Before you begin:
- You will be using node.js to run JavaScript through the terminal. Please read [install node](reading-material/install_node.md) to read about why we are using node.

## Remember your Unit Expectations!
- Pair at least twice this week.  *You need to pair 4 times on your own this unit*
- Give feedback for each person you paired with. *You need to submit at least 6 pieces of feedback in this unit*
- Rate at least 7 pieces of [Meta Feedback](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback) on Socrates. *You need to rate 20 pieces of feedback per unit*

## Submitting your work

**You need to submit your work through on [apply.devbootcamp.com](http://apply.devbootcamp.com) by Sunday at 11:59pm. When you log in, look at your profile page. There should be a "Unit 1 Week 2 Submission" form.** If you do not complete the challenges by Sunday, fill out the extension request form and complete the submission form when you finish.
