# Week 3: Introduction to Ruby

This week you'll transition to Ruby, where you'll stay for the next four weeks.

You'll want to get a copy of Chris Pine's [*Learn to Program, 2nd edition*](http://www.ebooks-it.net/ebook/learn-to-program-2nd-edition) for this week. You will be reading the content and then completing our challenges based on the content rather than his exercises.

Before you get started on the challenges this week, take a couple minutes to read Read Chris Pine's Introduction p. xi - xv.

Challenges:

## Fetch DBC's Changes
It's time to fetch changes from DevBootcamp's phase_0_unit 1 master repo! Make sure you are in the master branch of your phase-0-unit-1 repo. Check where you are in your terminal first. DO NOT try fetching these changes into your [USERNAME].github.io repo. You will mess things up!

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/fetching-changes.md)!

## Working through the challenges
Once you have the entire local repository on your computer, you don't need to read the challenges on github anymore (although we admit, it's prettier). You can open the entire repository in sublime and read the challenges in their original markdown. It will also help you find any link issues, since you can see where they are pointing. If you do find broken links, please let us by posting on the community, but also try to figure out a fix. It will help your markdown skills!

## Remember your Unit Expectations!
- Pair at least twice this week.  *You need to pair 4 times on your own this unit*
- Give feedback for each person you paired with. *You need to submit at least 6 pieces of feedback in this unit*
- Rate at least 7 pieces of [Meta Feedback](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback) on Socrates. *You need to rate 20 pieces of feedback per unit*

## Submitting your work

**You need to submit your work through on [apply.devbootcamp.com](http://apply.devbootcamp.com) by Sunday at 11:59pm. When you log in, look at your profile page. There should be a "Unit 1 Week 2 Submission" form.** If you do not complete the challenges by Sunday, fill out the extension request form and complete the submission form when you finish.
