# Week 3: Introduction to Ruby

<!-- Week 3's material is not ready yet!

We will release it with changes at least by the Friday before the week begins. -->

You'll want to get a copy of Chris Pine's [*Learn to Program, 2nd edition*](http://www.ebooks-it.net/ebook/learn-to-program-2nd-edition) for this week. You will be reading the content and then completing our challenges based on the content rather than his exercises.

Before you get started on the challenges this week, take a couple minutes to read Read Chris Pine's Introduction p. xi - xv.

Challenges:

2.
3.

## Fetch DBC's Changes
It's time to fetch changes from DevBootcamp's phase_0_unit 1 master repo! Make sure you are in the master branch of your phase-0-unit-1 repo. Check where you are in your terminal first. DO NOT try fetching these changes into your [USERNAME].github.io repo. You will mess things up!

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/fetching-changes.md)!

## Working through the challenges
Once you have the entire local repository on your computer, you don't need to read the challenges on github anymore (although we admit, it's prettier). You can open the entire repository in sublime and read the challenges in their original markdown. It will also help you find any link issues, since you can see where they are pointing. If you do find broken links, please let us by posting on the community, but also try to figure out a fix. It will help your markdown skills!
