## Learning Competencies


## Summary

## Releases

## Release 0: Read Ch. 5: Mixing it up
I can't tell you how many times you will (probably) make this mistake. It's incredibly important to know which kind of variable you are working with. If you don't know, you will get some crazy errors. Use IRB to practice as you read through it.

## Release 1: Try it out
Complete the two mini-challenges Pine created using Sublime and running it through your terminal. Paste your solution into the my_solution.md file associated with this challenge.

- Full name greeting: Write a program that asks for a person's first name, then middle, then last. Finally, it should greet the person using their full name.

- Bigger, better favorite number: Write a program that asks for a person's favorite number. Have your program add 1 to the number, and then suggest the result as a bigger and better number.

## Release 2: Creating Methods
At this point, we're going to deviate from Pine's book to introduce you to the idea of creating your own methods.
