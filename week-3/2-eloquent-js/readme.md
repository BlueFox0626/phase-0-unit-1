## Learning Competencies
-

## Summary
This book comes highly recommended by our staff, so we're asking you to read through it and answer some questions before starting the next challenges.

For each release, read the appropriate chapter and answer the questions in the [my_solution.js](my_solution.js) file. If you are less into writing, you can always record a video to include rather than text. It's up to you!

## Release 0: [Introduction](http://eloquentjavascript.net/00_intro.html)

## Release 1: [Ch. 1 Values, Types, and Operators](http://eloquentjavascript.net/01_values.html)

## Release 2: [Ch. 2 Program Structure](http://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html)

## Release 3: [Ch. 3 Functions](http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html)

Skip the sections on closure and recursion

## Release 4: [Ch. 4 Data Structures: Objects and Arrays](http://eloquentjavascript.net/04_data.html)

You may skip the sections on "The lycanthropeâ€™s log", "Computing Correlation", and "Further Arrayology" to "The Global Object." Read the summary.



## Release 5: Evaluate Code Combat
Now that you know a little bit about JavaScript, go to the Taunt the Guards challenge on [Code Combat](http://codecombat.com/play/level/taunt-the-guards).

Hover over `this` in the planning/spell section. What is it in terms of JavaScript? What does it include?

What are the available spells in terms of JavaScript? (don't list them out)

If you hover over the `say` method, what needs to be used in order to call the method?

You can choose whether to complete the actual challenge or not.

Now you should be ready to face the next challenges!

If you want to continue reading this book, we have no problem with that. You can even work through the exercises, but this is the end of what you will need for this week. Work to get a basic understanding of JavaScript fundamentals before you go deeper into the book.
