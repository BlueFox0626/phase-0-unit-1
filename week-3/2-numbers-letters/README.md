#U1.W3: Numbers, Letters, and Variable Assignment


## Learning Competencies
- Add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers in Ruby
- Compare integers and floats
- Identify and use strings
- Define local variables

## Summary
For these challenges you will want to read the chapters and actually do what he says even though much of it will probably be review from your pre-interview prep work. It's good to get it in your fingers and get used to typing these commands and strange symbols.

In this challenge you will go through basic mathematical operations,

## Releases

## Release 0: Read Ch. 2: Numbers
You may want to save everything in Sublime, or you can go in to your terminal and type `irb`. This stands for "<strong>i</strong>nteractive <strong>r</strong>u<strong>b</strong>y." (cute huh?) You can simply type any of these commands in what is essentially a ruby sandbox and see the output.

For example

```ruby
~ :> irb
irb(main):001:0> 1+2
=> 3
irb(main):002:0>
```


## Release 1: Summarize
Go to the [my_solution.md](my_solution.md) file associated with this challenge. Go to the numbers section and answer the questions in the "summary" section.

## Release 2: Try it!
In section 2.5, Pine provides two great mini challenges. Create these two programs and paste your code into the ruby section in your [my_solution.md](my_solution.md) file.

**Mini-challenges**
Write a program that calculates and outputs the:
1. Hours in a year
2. Minutes in a decade

## Release 3: Read Ch.3 Letters

Pay close attention, but you won't need to do any exercises based on this chapter.

## Release 4: Read Ch. 4 Variables and Assignment
Again, follow along and take a few notes (if you're that type of person) on variable assignment.

## Release 5: Exercises
Complete the following exercises on Socrates. We recommend writing the code in Sublime and testing it out on Socrates. Sometimes Socrates will time out and you will lose your code.

- [Defining Variables #1](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/exercises/1)
- [Simple String Methods](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/exercises/2)
- [Local Variables and Basic Arithmetical Operations](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/exercises/3)

Socrates won't allow an assignment to be complete until it passes some tests. If you have any red messages appear, those are the tests you will want to read and fix in your code.

## Release 6: Reflect
Using the [Reflection Guidelines](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md), reflect on what you learned. Write your response in the "Reflection" section of your my_solution.md file.

## Release 7: Review
Once you've solved the solutions, you can view others solutions by clicking on the exercise. There will be a "solutions" tab directly above the exercise name. Click on that tab to view the other solutions. Were any different (in terms of code as opposed to content)? How were they different?

The more code you read the easier it will be to learn how to refactor and get into code, so it's good practice to start now.
